# Dynamitab Documentation

  This file provides examples and definitions of every user accessible feature of the Dynamitab library. Like most projects' documentation, this file is a work in progress and I'd love it for anyone to submit a merge request to add to it.

  ## Usage

  Simply clone this repository:

    git clone https://gitlab.com/mcb2003/dynamitab dynamitab

  Then, you can include the Dynamitab library in your html code like this:

```html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="dynamitab/lib/dynamitab.js"></script>
```
